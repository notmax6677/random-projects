This text file just contains TODOs and game plans/ideas.

So basically i was thinking sort of like a procedural cave/space/underwater type of exploration game with minimal color schemes and a mysterious atmosphere.

Maybe kinda like a mostly monochrome coloring.

Horror style game.

maybe like hide-and-seek yk with like a demon shit chasing u

and you can barely see so you have a flashlight with like a few charges, and once it runs out you cant see anymore, and you also use the flashlight to make the monster go away
maybe a "survive until dawn" type of game

Huge thanks to Github co-pilot, it's really helping me a shit ton and helping with writing more complex or large codes

TODO:
- make player art and incorporate it into the game
